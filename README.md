# Meep Mobile Messenger #

Other messengers are boring. Meep uses our patent pending text 
parsing to convert regular boring text into beautiful awesome
memes!

## Requirements ##

* Meep is built on top of node and react-native
* Probably MacOS, because it runs on my machine!

## Install ##

	npm install

## Start the dev env ##

	npm start
	
## Totally Satire ##
Meep Mobile Messenger was created for the Comedy Hackathon held in
Huntsville, AL on September 10th, 2017 at Stand Up Live. Yes, it 
actually does work!
